# Repository Android Application Sentiment Analysis of Vaccination
## Sentiment Analysis of Vaccination (SAV)
Around 51% of Indonesians refuse and are confused by the COVID-19 vaccination. This is due to the lack of public knowledge about the importance of COVID-19 vaccination. They want to know public opinion about the COVID-19 vaccine in Indonesia and how the progress of vaccination is. Around 54% of respondents choose to use social media to access information about COVID-19 vaccination, with this social media as a benchmark for Indonesian people in making decisions regarding COVID-19 vaccination.
